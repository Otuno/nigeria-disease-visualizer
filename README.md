# Nigeria Disease Visualizer 🦠📊🇳🇬

A data visualization project that simulates the spread of diseases across Nigeria’s states using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

---

## Project Overview

The **Nigeria Disease Visualizer** is a research-inspired tool visualizing disease case trends across Nigerian states. Ideal for exploring infection patterns and informing public health analysis.

---

## Features

- Visualizes simulated disease counts across states  
- Includes bar charts, pie charts, and trend analysis  
- Demonstrates grouping, filtering, and plotting techniques

## How to Run

### ⚙️ Option 1: Run in Google Colab
1. Click the **Open in Colab** badge (or go to Colab manually)  
2. Upload `disease_data.csv`  
3. Run all cells to generate the visualizations  
4. Confirm screenshots match those above

### ⚙️ Option 2: Run Locally
1. Clone the repo  
2. Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Launch `notebooks/disease_analysis.ipynb`  
4. Ensure `data/disease_data.csv` is in the correct directory

## Future Improvements

- Integrate real NCDC or WHO data
- Add predictive analytics (e.g., trend forecasts)
- Build deployable dashboard with Streamlit or Dash
- Include interactivity like filtering and tool‑tips
